    "### LUT optimization for Memory Based Computation / Verilog\n",
    "   •\tAntisymmetric product coding (APC) and modified Odd Multiple storage (OMS) scheme and combined them for efficient memory-based multiplication. The combined approach provides a reduction in LUT size to one-fourth of the conventional LUT.\n",
